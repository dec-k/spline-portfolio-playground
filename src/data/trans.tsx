      <>
        I'm a developer with many years of experience across a variety of
        platforms. This site will change often as I find shiny new things to
        try. <br />
        This site is currently built with:
        <br />
        - React.JS
        <br />
        - Chakra UI
        <br />
        - react-three-fiber
        <br />
        - Spline
        <br />
      </>
    ),
  },
};
