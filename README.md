# Portfolio

Hey - first of all, thank you for taking an interest!

This repository is public in order to demystify the approach taken towards things like:

- Code organisation
- "How'd he do that?" moments
- Elegant typesript

Feel free to leave an issue if you encounter issues with the site, and I'll have a gander as soon as possible.

## Technical Stuff

This app is deployed via **Vercel** which I highly recommend.

The 3D stuff is managed via **react-three-fiber**, a react wrapper for Three.js.

The 3D stuff is _created_ inside **Spline**, which I'd also recommend.

The UI library of choice is **Chakra UI** due to its low opinionation and easy theming.
