# Landing Site

Hey hey - this is my current portfolio and somewhat of a testbed for trying new things such as languages, frameworks, etc.

## Technical Stuff

This app is deployed via **Vercel** which I highly recommend.
The 3D stuff is managed via **react-three-fiber**, a react wrapper for Three.js.
The 3D stuff is _created_ inside **Spline**, which I'd also recommend.
